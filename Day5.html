- <ul> with at least 4 items:
  - HTML basics
  - page structure
  - writing from memory
  - consistency

Section 2: "Why I’m Doing This"
- <h2>
- 2–3 <p> elements
- Talk about:
  - avoiding framework confusion
  - understanding fundamentals
  - not rushing the process

Section 3: "Daily Rules"
- <h2>
- <ol> with:
  - code daily
  - rewrite from scratch
  - don’t rush ahead

        <h1>Day 5 of HTML Practice</h1>
        <p>In this 5th day of me relearning HTML, I am aiming to rewrite code from the previous day from scratch. I wanna build it
            without checking it. I wanna build muscle memory. At the end of this journey, I want to be able to understand frontend
            with little to no effort.

            <h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>
            <p>So far, in the 5 days that I am learning HTML, I have remembered all these concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML Basics</li>
                <li>Semantics</li>
                <li>Rewriting from memory</li>
                <li>Consistency for everyday</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section>
            <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
            <p>As a third year BSIS student, I feel like I am being left out. I feel like people are advancing way too fast and
                I feel like I am being left behind. That is why I decided to make a move. To do this daily coding practice. To
                build muscle memory, to build a habit. To become better. As a student, and as a future asset in the workforce.
            </p>
            <p>In the technical perspective, as I am also studying Python backend programming, I am relearning Frontend so I will
                be ready when I get into Python Frameworks such as Django, FastAPI, and others. I thought that if i could not 
                comprehend basic frontend code, I might have a hard time understanding frameworks if all i do is backend.                
            </p>
            <p>I am also doing this to not rush the process. I believe that great things take time. As they say, "Rome wasn't built in a day."
                So I am taking my time, ensuring that each day, when I learn new things, I really store it in my brain. So that
                I can prevent that "I am progressing. But am I really learning?" mentality. Because that thought eats me up so 
                much inside. I think this is a symptom of imposter syndrome, lol.

            <h2>Daily Rules</h2>
            <p>In this daily frontend practice, I follow these simple rules: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Code everyday. Even ugly code counts.</li>
                <li>Start from scratch. No overwriting existing code.</li>
                <li>Little to no googling.</li>
                <li>20 to 30 minutes allotted time. </li>
            </ol>
