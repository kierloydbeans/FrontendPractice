<!--
DAY 4 – HTML FRONTEND PRACTICE

GOAL:
Learn proper HTML structure using semantic tags.
Make the page read like a document, not a random collection of tags.

REQUIRED TAGS (MUST USE ALL):
- header
- nav
- main
- section (at least 2)
- footer

PAGE THEME (PICK ONE):
- My Daily Coding Journey
- Why I’m Relearning the Basics
- Backend Guy Learning Frontend
- Or your own theme (stick to one)

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Exactly ONE h1 (page title)
- At least THREE h2
- At least FOUR p
- ONE ul
- ONE ol
- ONE nav with at least THREE links (href="#" is fine)

STRUCTURE RULES:
- header  -> title + short intro
- nav     -> navigation links
- main    -> all actual content
- section -> grouped ideas (use at least 2)
- footer  -> closing thoughts, date, or signature

RULES:
- No CSS
- No JavaScript
- No copy-paste from old files
- Write from memory
- You may compare with previous days AFTER finishing

TIME TARGET:
15–30 minutes (thinking time counts)

OPTIONAL BONUS:
- Add comments explaining WHY you used certain tags

REMINDER:
HTML has flow.
It’s document flow, not logic flow.

            <h2>Why am I relearning frontend?</h2>
            <h3>Reassociation</h3>
            <p>I am relearning frontend because I got too focused on backend that I became hopeless on the littlest frontend bug. A little css mismatch and I am struggling.
                It becomes a major issue on pre-defense preparation because I tend to freeze up on them. I want to fix that.
            </p>
            <h3>Muscle Memory</h3>
            <p>I want to know the basic fundamentals of frontend programming to the point that i can type it from my memory. I don't need a fancy frontend, just something that
                is functional.
            </p>
            <h3>Preparation for Python Frameworks</h3>
            <p>As you may have already know, I am also studying and practicing python daily. As I am slowly building my python skills, I wanna be prepared when I got to the
                frameworks part. I know that if I don't know frontend fundamentals, I will still struggle with frameworks even if I learned python backend.
