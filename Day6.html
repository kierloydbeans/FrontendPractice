        <h1>Day 6 of Frontend HTML Practice</h1>
        <p>This will be about the 6th day of my HTML practice. I decided the contents of these daily practice will be diary-like. That way, I won't run out of what to put.</p>

            <h2>Morning Reflections</h2>
            <p>I woke up earlier than usual today. However, my nose was clogged so I had to stand up and get it out. Felt better. Had breakfast, then went straight to daily
                python practice. I decided I will stream today's since its the day I moved into learning loops. So I set up OBS.

            <h2>Python Loops Experience</h2>
            <p>I wanted to stream so I can build confidence and my English speaking skills. However, nerves got the best of me. I couldn't think straight while the stream is
                ongoing. I struggled with while loops. I had a hard time with the infinite loops. So I ended the stream. I took a break and ate lunch. After I ate lunch, I
                watched a video about python while loops from Bro Code. And man, it helped a lot. I got to realize while loops alwasy do what is right. So we have to declare
                the limits, the <strong>"what's wrong"</strong>. The limiters that will stop the code from repeating itself. After realizing that while loops should declare what is wrong and
                that the <strong>"right"</strong> code should be at the end, I finished the rest of teh tasks pretty fast. I am glad. We still got a python class later at 6pm as well.
