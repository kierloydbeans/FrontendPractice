         <h2>Day 2 of HTML and Frontend Practice</h2>
    <!-- 3 or more p --> 
        <p>In this day, I want to rewrite the code from the other day from memory. As a learning
            individual, I want to relearn the basics of frontend programming and all of the 
            fundamentals so I would easier understand frameworks when i get to it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I believe I am doing myself a favor in this because I am coding everyday. I am
            trying to build a habit of coding everyday until I find it to be a part of my life.
            "Code everyday, even if its ugly.", that's what I tell myself. Even if it feels
            tiring. I want to get better. For me. For her. For my family. For my future family.
